## Rive Lab

A next.js playground for animations created with [Rive](https://rive.app/). ðŸŽ‰

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Unfortunatly there is no loader to import the .rive files directly into the bundle. Therefore you can find the .rive files inside the /public folder.
